# Zirconium Jackrabbit - WIP
***!mih teG !yawa gninnur s’eh ,tibbarkcaJ a s’eH .oh oh oh oh oh hO***

This is a derivative Zirconium image, designed specifically for handheld users. It makes use of OpenGamepadUI, input-plumber and the CachyOS Kernel *(An alternative kernel will probably be used in the future.)*

There will be rebase instructions in the future. If you're a curious advanced user, you should know how to use it already.
